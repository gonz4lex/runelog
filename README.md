# Runelog
## Lightweight ML Tracker

A simple, file-based Python library for tracking machine learning experiments, inspired by MLflow.

**Current Status**: In active development. The core API is functional but subject to change.

The name *Runelog* is a play on words. It evokes the common `run.log()` command used to log an experiment, while also treating your powerful, and sometimes mysterious, models as modern-day mystical writings: a "log of runes".

##  Why Runelog?

- **Zero-Overhead Setup** â€“ start tracking runs in a single line
- **Local-First, Lightweight** â€“ perfect for solo devs or small teams
- **Portable & Transparent** â€“ data is stored in simple folders/files

##  Installation

### User Setup

This is the recommended way to install `runelog` if you just want to use it in your projects.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install the library from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install runelog
```

That's it! You can now import it into your Python scripts.

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gonz4lex/runelog.git
cd runelog
```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Quickstart

Start tracking your ML experiments in just a few lines of code. This example trains a simple model and logs its parameters, accuracy, and the model file itself.

```python
from runelog import get_tracker
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# 1. Initialize the tracker
tracker = get_tracker()

# 2. Get or create an experiment to log to
experiment_id = tracker.create_experiment("Example")

# 3. Start a run within your experiment
with tracker.start_run(experiment_id=experiment_id):
    params = {"solver": "liblinear", "C": 0.5}

    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
    
    model = LogisticRegression(**params).fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Log the parameters used for this run
    tracker.log_parameter("solver", params["solver"])
    tracker.log_parameter("C", params["C"])
    
    # Log the resulting performance metric
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y, model.predict(X))
    tracker.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)

    # Log the trained model file
    tracker.log_model(model, "logreg.pkl")
```

After running this script, you can view the results in the Streamlit UI.

#### Usage Examples
You can find example scripts in the `examples/ directory`:

`train_model.py`

Full pipeline example with:
* logging parameters and metrics
* saving and registering models
* tagging and retrieving models

Run it:

```bash
python examples/train_model.py
```

`minimal_tracking.py`

Minimal working example with only metric logging.

Run it:

```bash
python examples/minimal_tracking.py
```
